The p2 update site for antlr4 sources.

Building a p2 update site for a maven plugin was realized using the 'p2-maven-plugin' maven plugin which can be found at https://github.com/reficio/p2-maven-plugin.

The idea of building the p2 update site using TravisCI 
and make it available on GitHub through GitHub Pages comes from the following post
